-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Navigating the system

To navigate files and directories in operating systems you can use GUI or *command-line interface* (through *shell*). These files and directories are organized in a hierarchical directory tree (main directory branches off and holds other directories and files).

### 1.1. Basics

- file systems are assigned to drive letters, e.g., `C:`, `D:` (`A:` and `B:` were used for floppy drives)
- subdirectories are separated by `\` (back slash)
- in every file system there is a special folder for deleted files (`$RECYCLE.BIN`)
- there are two *command-line interfaces* available: **Command Prompt** (since MS DOS) and **PowerShell** (many [*PowerShell*](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell/README.md) commands are aliases for common commands in other shells)
- strings in command line can be denoted by `'my folder'` or by ``my` folder`` (`` ` `` is the escape character)
- *PowerShell* commands often have a verb-noun format (*commandlet*)
- *tab completion* and *wildcards* are available in *PowerShell*

**Most common commands**:
```
<command> <options> <arguments>

Get-Help <command>  : manual (-Full more info)
<command> /?        : manual for Command Prompt commands
Get-Alias <command> : get PowerShell command from its alias
echo <str>          : print input
clear               : clear screen (or ctrl + L)
history             : show command history (or ctrl + R for search, or #<command> and tab completion)
exit                : close terminal

pwd                 : print working directory
ls <path>           : list files and directories (-Force for hidden files)
tree <path>         : list files and directories in a tree-like format
cd <path>           : change directory
mkdir <path>        : create directory
rm <path>           : remove file/directory (-Recurse for directory, -Force)
cp <path1> <path2>  : copy file/directory (-Recurse for directory, -Verbose)
mv <path1> <path2>  : move (or rename) file/directory
```

**Wildcards** (symbols used to represent one or more characters):
```
~                   : user directory (i.e., `C:\Users\<user>`)
..                  : one level up
.                   : current directory
?                   : any symbol
*                   : any number of any symbols
```

**PowerShell shortcuts**:

| shortcut                                      | description           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> / <kbd>V</kbd> | copy/paste            |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>                | clear terminal screen |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>                | kill current process  |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                                | tab completion        |



### 1.2. File and text manipulation

```
cat  <file>         : view contents of a file (-Head/-Tail <N> for first/last N lines)
more <file>         : open file with more text editor

```

Windows has a service called the *Windows Search Service*, which indexes files on a computer and compiles a list of their names and properties. This is a resource intensive process, so by default it's enabled only for files in user home directory in Windows 10, and disabled on Windows Servers. For the same reason you can't search data within files by default (to enable: `Indexing Options → Advanced → File Types → Index Properties and File Contents [X]`). 

Search via *PowerShell*:

- within directories: `ls <path> -Recurse -Filter <str>`
- within files (could use regexes): `sls <str> <files>`


### 1.3. I/O streams and the pipeline

- there are three main I/O streams: **stdin** (files/keyboard), **stdout** (screen by default) and **stderr** (screen by default)
- the direction of these streams can be changed with *redirector operators*
- there is a special variable that contains the definition of nothing (`$null`)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data/shell IO streams.png" width="500" title="Shell I/O streams"></p>

```
<com>  <   <file>   : stdin from file
<com>  >   <file>   : stdout to file (rewrite)
<com>  >>  <file>   : stdout to file (append)
<com>  2>  <file>   : stderr to file (rewrite)
<com>  2>> <file>   : stderr to file (append)
<com1> | <com2>     : pipeline (stdin[i+1] = stdout[i])
```


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Users and permissions

### 2.1. Users and groups

- there are two different types of users: *standard users* (have restricted access) and *administrators* (have complete control of a machine, i.e., can grant access for other users, install software, change restricted system settings, etc.).
- good practice: not to be logged in as administrator all the time, but use your own account, and acquire *admin privileges* only when you need them (with the help of UAC, or *user access control*, which prevents unauthorized changes to a system)
- good [password practice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc875839(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN): administrator sets a default password for user, and then makes them change it on the next log in
- there is a special user *guest* that's allowed to use the computer without a password (disabled by default)
- users are put together in *groups* according to levels of access and permissions
- *authenticated users* group is a group of users with passwords (i.e., excludes *guest* users)

Users and groups can be managed in *Local Users and Groups* tab of *Computer Management tool* or through *PowerShell*:

1. **Computer Management tool**:
    - *Task Scheduler* (schedule programs and tasks to run at certain times)
    - *Event Viewer* (view system logs)
    - *Shared folders* (manage folders that can be shared between users)
    - *Local Users and Groups* (user and group management)
    - *Performance* (monitor resources of a machine)
    - *Device Manager* (i.e., network cards, sound cards, monitors, etc.)
    - *Disk Management* (storage management)
    - *Services and Applications* (manage programs and services available on the system)


2. **PowerShell**:
    ```
    Get-LocalUser                : show list of local users
    Get-LocalGroup               : show list of local groups
    Get-LocalGroupMember <group> : show list of users in a group

    net user <user> * /add       : add new user (/logonpasswordchg:yes force password change on next log in)
    net user <user> /delete      : delete user
    net user <user> *            : change user password
    ```


### 2.2. Permissions


Files and folder permissions are assigned using ACLs ([*access control lists*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-control-lists?redirectedfrom=MSDN)):

- there are DACLs (*discretionary ACLs*), which are used for permissions management, and SACLs (*system ACLs*), which are used to make access logs
- every file and folder will have an owner and one or more DACLs
- there are *simple permissions* and [*special permissions*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732880(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

| Permission               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|:------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Read**                 | <ul><li>files: see that file exists and read its contents</li><li>folders: read the files and folders in a folder</li></ul>                        |
| **Read and execute**     | <ul><li>files: read files and execute (if possible)</li><li>folders: read and execute files in folder</li><li>includes *read* permission</li></ul> |
| **List folder contents** | <ul><li>folders: read and execute files in folder</li><li>alias for *read and execute* on a folder</li></ul>                                       |
| **Write**                | <ul><li>files: make changes</li><li>folders: create subfolders and write files in the folder</li></ul>                                             |
| **Modify**               | <ul><li>includes *read*, *execute* and *write* permissions</li></ul>                                                                                |
| **Full Control**         | <ul><li>includes *modify* permission </li><li>gives ability to take ownership of a file and change its ACLs</li></ul>                              |

DACLs can be viewed and modified via GUI or through *PowerShell*:

1. **GUI**:
    - via `Properties → Security`: top box for list of users and groups, bottom box for list of permissions
    - *deny* option doesn't allow to have certain permissions (takes precedence over *allow* option)

2. **PowerShell**:
    ```
    ICACL (improved change ACL utility)

    icacls <path>                : show permissions for a file/folder
    icacls <path> /grant <arg>   : change file/folder permissions
    icacls <path> /remove <arg>  : remove file/folder permissions
    ```


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Package and software management

### 3.1. Software packages

Developers package software using *software compiling tools*. In Windows, software is usually packaged as `.exe` files (*executable files*). They contain instructions for a computer to perform, computer code and other files that program might use.

- *executables* are created according to Microsoft's [PE format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable) (*portable executable*)
- *executables*:
    - can contain an `.msi` file (*Microsoft install package*), which is used to guide the *Windows Installer* in the installation, maintenance, and removal of a program
    - or alternatively, can be used as stand-alone custom installers (no `.msi` file inside and no usage of the *Windows Installer*)
- *Windows Store* (application repository for Windows apps) uses `.appx` [format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/appxpkg/make-appx-package--makeappx-exe-?redirectedfrom=MSDN) for packages
- programs can be installed using GUI or *PowerShell*
- some executables can have option for special flags that allow silent installation, auto reboot after instalation, etc.

Packages usually rely on other pieces of code in order to work. In Windows these dependencies are *dynamic-link libraries*, or [DLLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library).

- same DLL can be used by lots of different programs
- a given installation package will have all the needed resources and dependencies (like DLLs)
- *side-by-side assemblies* (or SxS) are used for shared libraries and resources management to avoid conflicts between different versions of same DLLs (stored in `C:\Windows\WinSxS`)


### 3.2. Package managers

In addition to SxS system *Windows Package Manager* can be used to install and maintain the libraries and other dependencies. A package manager makes sure that the process of software installation, removal, update, and dependency management is as easy and automatic as possible.

- [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) is a default package source
- popular third party alternatives: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages) and [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/)
- in a busyness environment private repositories can be used

```
Register-PackageSource -Name chocolatey -ProviderName Chocolatey -Location https://chocolatey.org/api/v2 : add Chocolatey as a package source
Get-PackageSource                        : show a package source (to verify)

Find-Package <name> -IncludeDependencies : locate package with its dependencies
Install-Package -Name <name>             : install package
Get-Package <name>                       : verify that package is installed
Uninstall-Package -Name <name>           : uninstall package
```

Most Windows software is distributed in closed source packages (i.e., source code is hidden), but there are tools to check out [installer actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-examples?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (e.g., process monitoring from [*sysinterals* toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) or [*orca*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/orca-exe?redirectedfrom=MSDN) from Windows SDK).


### 3.3. Archives

**Archive** is one or more files compressed into a single file.

- popular archive types: `.tar`, `.zip`, and `.rar`
- archives can be used for software packaging (*installing from source*)
- popular open source tool for working with archives: 7-zip, it can be used via GUI or PowerShell (with `Compress-Archive` [command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.archive/compress-archive?view=powershell-7&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-5.0))


### 3.4. Mobile app packages

*Mobile applications* usually can be downloaded only from a trusted source (like an *app store*). *App store* is a central managed marketplace for app developers to publish and sell mobile apps, i.e., the *app store* acts as *package manager*, and the *app store service* acts as a *package repository*.

- mobile apps are standalone software packages (i.e., contain all dependencies)
- apps on an *app store* have usually been through a security review and have been approved by the store owner
- apps on an *app store* are signed by the developer, and if the source code is changed, the signature becomes invalid
- in a business environment *enterprise app management* tools are used
- mobile apps can be installed from other sources too (*side-loading*)
- mobile apps store data in *cache* (so clearing cache will reset all the settings and delete all the user app data)


### 3.5. Devices and drivers

**Driver** is software that helps hardware device interact with an OS.

In Windows devices and their drivers are managed through the *Device Manager* (access through `devmgmt.msc` or `RMB on This PC → Manage → Device Manager`).

- Device Manager groups devices together by categories
- when a new device is plugged into a computer [*Windows Plug n Play*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-plug-and-play) system automatically detects it:
    1. Windows asks device for its [*hardware ID*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/hardware-ids) (string of characters set by vendor to [identify a device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/step-1--the-new-device-is-identified)).
    2. Windows searches for appropriate drivers (locally or in a driver store).
    3. Windows [installs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/step-2--a-driver-for-the-device-is-selected) new drivers.
- Device Manager also allows to manually uninstall, disable and update drivers

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data/PlugnPlay.png" width="550" title="Plug n Play"></p>


### 3.6. OS updates

Installing latest system updates is a good practice to keep OS secure and get the newest features. In Windows this process is managed by the *Windows Update Client*, which always runs in the background.

- *Windows Update Client* checks *Windows Update* servers for new updates and patches, and if they are available downloads and installs them
- in Windows 10, updates are cumulative (i.e., every package of updates and patches supersedes the previous one)
- in Windows 10, installing updates is no longer optional


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. File systems

### 4.1. Review of file systems

A *file system* is used to keep track of files and file storage on a disk. The major operating systems have their own unique file systems:

- Windows uses **NTFS** by default, and Linux uses **ext4** (most common)
- for most file systems, cross OS support is minimal (e.g., Windows doesn't read *ext4*).
- there is also [**FAT32**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/154997/description-of-the-fat32-file-system) file system (used for flash drives):
    - supported by all three major operating systems
    - allows only for files smaller than 4 GB
    - max size of a file system is 32 GB


### 4.2. Partitions

A *storage disk* can be divided into **partitions** (pieces of the disk that can be managed independently). Partitions essentially act as separate sub-disks, but they all use the same physical disk.

- file system can only be added on a partition
- different partitions of the same physical disk can use different file systems
- when a file system is formated on a partition, it becomes a **volume**

**Partition table** is a component of a disk that tells the OS how the disk is partitioned (which are the boot partitions, space allocated for partitions, etc.)

There are two main *partition table schemes* which decide how to structure the information on partitions:

1. **MBR (master boot record)**
    - mostly used in Windows, slowly being replaced by GPT
    - max volume size is 2 TB
    - max four *primary* partitions on a disk (can add more with *extended* and *logical* partitions)

2. **GPT (GUID partition table)**
    - max volume size is 8 ZB
    - max 128 partitions on a disk (i.e., all partitions are *primary*)
    - UEFI booting is supported only for GPT devices


### 4.3. Disk partitioning, formatting and mounting

In Windows, *disk partitioning* and *filesystem formatting* can be done through the *Disk Management* utility (GUI) or with the [*Diskpart*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-vista/cc766465(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) tool (CLI):

1. **Disk Management**
    1. create a partition from an unallocated space on a disk
    2. format a volume on this partition by choosing:
        - volume label and used filesystem
        - [*allocation unit size*](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/140365/default-cluster-size-for-ntfs-fat-and-exfat) (size of the data blocks that will be used on a partition)
        - quick/full format
        - file and folder compression on/off (enabling compression will take some resources from CPU)

2. **Diskpart**

    ```
    list disk                    : list disks
    select disk <N>              : select disk
    list partition               : list partitions for selected disk
    select partition <N>         : select partition

    clean                        : remove all partitions and volume formatting from the selected disk
    create partition primary     : create primary partition on a selected disk
    active                       : make selected partition active
    format FS=<FS> label=<name>  : format selected partition
    delete partition override    : delete selected partition
    ```

After a filesystem has been formatted it needs to be *mounted* to a drive (to make it accessible). Windows does this automatically.


### 4.4. Virtual memory

**Virtual memory** allows OS provide the available physical memory (RAM) to the running applications. It creates a mapping between virtual and physical addresses. *Virtual memory* allows programs:

- not to worry about what portions of memory are used by other programs
- not to worry about where the data they use is located in RAM
- use more memory than physically available (by using a **swap area** on a hard drive)

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data/virtual memory.png" width="400" title=" "></p>

When a particular *page of data* (data block) isn't being used by an application, it gets evicted (copied out of memory onto the hard drive). This way memory resources are used most efficiently, and if a program needs a page that's not accessed a lot, the OS can still get to it in *swap*.

In Windows virtual memory and [pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging#Windows_NT) are managed by the **Memory Manager**. Pages are stored in a hidden file `pagefile.sys` on the root partition of a volume. Default settings ([size, number and location](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/determine-appropriate-page-file-size) of page files) can be changed from a control panel (`control panel → system and security settings → system → advanced system settings → advanced → settings (performance) → advanced`).


### 4.5. Files and metadata

NTFS file system uses **MFT (master file table)** to store and represent files and their metadata on a volume.

- every file on a volume has at least one entry in the MFT (including the MFT itself)
- usually, there's a one-to-one correspondence between files and MFT records, but if a file has a lot of attributes, there might be more than one record to represent it
- each entry in the MFT has a unique identifier called the *file record number*
- there are special types of a files in Windows that provide access to other files: *shortcuts*, [*symbolic links*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/creating-symbolic-links?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and [*hard links*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/hard-links-and-junctions?redirectedfrom=MSDN):
    1. **Shortcuts**
        - reference to some destination
        - OS treats *shortcuts* like pointers to another files
    2. **Symbolic links**
        - MFT entry points to the name of another entry (i.e., if the name of the destination file is changed, the link will stop working)
        - OS treats *symbolic links* like substitutes for files
        - create with `mklink <symlink> <file>`
    3. **Hard links**
        - MFT entry points to the *file record number* of another entry (i.e., if the name of the destination file is changed, the link will still work)
        - OS treats *hard links* like substitutes for files
        - create with `mklink /H <hardlink> <file>`


### 4.6. Disk usage

In Windows, monitoring of disk usage can be done with the *Disk Management* tool or with the *disk usage* utility (from *sysinternals*).

- there is an option for *disk cleanup* (with `CleanManager.exe`) to free some disk space by deleting temporary files, compressing rarely used ones, cleaning up logs and emptying the recycle bin
- *defragmentation* is a useful task for hard disk drive maintenance (in Windows), it reorganizes files on a disk to make them easier to access (*defragmentation* is useless for SSD's, a process called *trim* is used instead)
- in Windows *defragmentation* is handled as a scheduled task


### 4.7. File system repair

Data corruption could happen for lots of reasons:

- unsafe removing of a disk drive (i.e., data might not to be transferred from buffer to a device in time)
- unexpected power shut downs
- system failures and software bugs

NTFS file system has features that minimize the danger of data corruption, as well as, features that recover data when it gets damaged:

- *journaling* creates *NTFS logs* by monitoring changes in files metadata, so if a particular file gets corrupted, the file system will recover the previous state of a file
- *self-healing* mechanism addresses minor problems and corruptions on the disk automatically in the background (to check the status use `fsutil repair query <path>` in PowerShell with admin privileges)
- *check disk* utility is used for serious data corruption, i.e., bad disk sectors, disk failures, etc. (`chkdsk` in PowerShell with admin privileges):
    ```
    chkdsk                       : check disks health
    chkdsk /F <path>             : check disk health and fix found problems
    ```
- if Windows detects that some data on a disk has been corrupted it sets a special flag in its metadata, so `chkdsk` will see it on the next boot and will try to repair data automatically

## 5. Process management

### 5.1. Processes

**Program** is an application that a user can run.

**Process** is a program that's executing (i.e., user can have many processes of the same program running at the same time, e.g., browser tabs of a web browser).

- when Windows boots, the first non-kernel user process that starts is `smss.exe` (*session manager subsystem*); it's followed by `winlogon.exe` (*log-in process*) and `csrss.exe` (*client/server runtime subsystem*), which handles the GUI and command-line interface
- in Windows, processes have a *parent-child* relationship, i.e., every process has a parent (child process inherit some things like variables and settings, i.e., *environment*)
- Windows processes can operate independently of their parents (unlike in Linux), i.e., if user terminates a parent of a process, it will still continue to run
- user can terminate processes with `taskkill /pid <PID>`


### 5.2. Process monitoring

In Windows process monitoring can be handled with the **Task Manager** (`taskmgr.exe`), which can be accessed with:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd> shortcut
- GUI
- *Command Prompt* with `tasklist` utility
- *PowerShell* with `Get-Process` [command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-process?view=powershell-5.1)


### 5.3. Process management

In Windows, in addition to **Task Manager** there is also a more powerful process management tool: **Process Explorer**.  It doesn't come preinstalled with Windows, but can be downloaded from [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer). It allows to:

- view currently active processes (top window pane)
- see the list of files a selected process is using (bottom window pane)
- see parent-child hierarchy
- search for a process (with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>)

Process management:

1. **Kill Process**
2. **Kill Process Tree** (kill the process and all of its descendants)
3. **Restart** (as a child of `procexp.exe`)
4. **Suspend** (to continue it later)
5. **Resume** (for suspended processes)

Sometimes user might want to interrupt a process before it fully completes. **Signals** are used for that purpose, they can be generated through other processes and software, or with keyboard shortcuts. Most common *signal* in Windows is **SIGINT** (*signal interrupt*), which can be generated with a <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> shortcut. There are other *signals*, but there isn't an easy way to issue them [in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/signal?view=vs-2019).


### 5.4. Resource monitoring

In Windows, user can monitor system resources with the **Resource Monitoring** tool. It can be accessed through *PowerShell* with `Get-Process` [command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-process?view=powershell-5.1#outputs).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. Operating systems in practice

### 6.1. Remote connection

There are several protocols for remote connection in Windows:

1. **SSH (secure shell)**

    - *SSH client* needs to be installed on a user computer, and *SSH server* on a host machine (populars programs: OpenSSH and PuTTy)
    - *SSH server* doesn't need to be a physical machine, it can be just a software, that's running as a background process
    - *openSSH*: `ssh <user>@<host>`
        - user has to have an account on a host machine
        - can access host using an *IP address* or a *host name*
        - can specify a port with `-p <port>` (`22` by default for SSH)
    - *PuTTy*: using GUI or with `putty.exe -ssh <user>@<host> <port>` in *PowerShell*
    - when user connects to a remote machine for the first time, they will be asked to verify the authenticity of a host, and after confirmation host will be added to the list of known hosts
    - SSH *authentication keys* can be used instead of passwords (more secure)

2. **RDP (remote desktop protocol)**

    - enable remote connections on host machine: `This PC → Properties → Remote Settings → enable remote connections`
    - `mstsc.exe` (Microsoft terminal services client) is used to create RDP connections (can be used through GUI or *PowerShell*)
    - there are also Linux and Mac clients (RealVNC, Microsoft RDP)
    - can specify the list of users who can access the host machine

3. **VPN (virtual private network)**


### 6.2. Remote file transfer

1. **SSH tunnels**
    - with *PuTTy secure copy client*: `pscp.exe <path1> <user>@<host>:<path2>`
    - might be time consuming for transfering files to multiple machines

2. **Shared folders**
    - built-in mechanism in Windows
    - can be configured in folder properties
    - after folder is marked as shared, user needs to map it as a network drive
    - `net share` in *PowerShell* to show a list of *shared folders* on a computer


### 6.3. Logs

In most systems, there is a service that runs in the background and constantly writes events to logs. In Windows, the logged events are stored in the **Event Viewer** (`eventvwr.msc`).

- by default *Event Viewer* shows a summary of potentially important recent events
- more information about selected event is displayed in the bottom pane
- shows different event groupings (at the left-hand pane):
    1. *Custom Views* (allows to filter events by type, name, time, severity (right-hand pane))
    2. *Windows Logs* (OS logs)
    3. *Application and Services* (events from applications and OS components)


### 6.4. OS deployment

Installing an OS on a large number of machines using traditional methods (e.g., with a USB stick) can be very time consuming, so different methods are used instead:

1. **Disk cloning**
2. **Network initiated deployment**
    - request the images directly from the network
    - there are ways to use custom images too
